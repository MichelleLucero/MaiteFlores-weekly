### Project Updates 
--- 
Since last week I believe we have made a lot of progress. At first we were slowly getting work done but we still hadn’t opened 
a pull request. Earlier this week we opened a pull request but we ended up failing the backend tests. We couldn’t figure out 
what was going on for a few days since we didn’t know how to fix the backend tests we were failing. After failing the tests we
also realized that the formatting of our pull request was done properly. So while I was looking through the project files, 
Gillian and Christina fixed the formatting.  In the days following, we still couldn’t figure out the backend issues we were 
having. 
###### 4/24/2020
On Friday we sat down once again to try to figure out what to do. With the help of one of the core contributors we got the 
backend issues resolved. The reason for us failing the backend issues was due to a miscommunication amongst ourselves. We all 
had thought that someone within the group had fetched the data from the [Zulip repository](https://github.com/zulip/zulip) 
when in reality none of us had. After fetching from the repository we did a pull request. While this time we passed more tests,
unfortunately we did not pass them all.  After we failed these tests I decided to run tests on my local machine. Originally 
the tests were ran by Gillian on her machine but those tests were ran before we fetched from the repository. We hadn’t ran the 
tests again on our local machines because we hadn’t made any changes to the files we were working on so we didn’t think to test
the files after fetching. This time when I ran the tests on the most updated version I found some problems. The file we were 
modifying was an **hbs** file and it appeared to be space/indent sensitive. Running the command ***./tools/lint —fix*** allowed
us to automatically fix the problems.  

After no issues were found I decided to push to the [hunter-tulip repository](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/zulip). 
Zulip has very [specific commands](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/pull-requests.html#work-in-progress-pull-requests) 
they want followed. While I thought I had followed the instructions apparently I did something wrong but we didn’t realize it 
at the time. I pushed to the Hunter repository and the tests ran again. This time we passed all the tests and the pull request
was closed. What we didn’t realized was I had rebased and cleared our files so all the tests passed but thats only because 
nothing was really being tested. Unfortunately the pull request had been automatically closed and core contributor Tim Abbot 
told us we had to open another pull request with the fixed files. 

###### 4/25/2020 
After what happened on Friday I was a bit hesitant to be the one to push to the hunter repository. Christina recovered our 
files and I was asked to fix the issues on the files again. I fetched all the data and fixed the files that had been reverted 
to an earlier version from this week. Since I didn’t want to mess up the rebasing and pushing again I decided to make a copy 
of the files and send them to Christina to rebase and push on her machine. A new pull request was made and all the tests 
[passed](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/14755).
